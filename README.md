# System Programming Course - C++ WinAPI Laboratory Works

This repository contains a collection of 9 laboratory works completed as part of the System Programming course, focusing on C++ programming with the WinAPI framework. Each laboratory work explores different aspects of system programming using C++ and demonstrates the usage of WinAPI for Windows application development.

## Laboratory Works

The repository includes the following laboratory works:

1. **Lab 1**: Structure of Windows Applications. Window Procedure
   - Description: This lab introduces the structure of Windows applications and covers the concept of the Window Procedure. It demonstrates how to create a basic Windows application and handle various window messages.

2. **Lab 2**: Information Entry Means
   - Description: This lab focuses on information entry in Windows applications using WinAPI. It explores various GUI components for user input, such as text boxes, buttons, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

3. **Lab 3**: Device Contexts. Output of Text and Graphics
   - Description: In this lab, you will learn about device contexts (DC) and how to use them for outputting text and graphics in Windows applications. It covers topics such as font selection, text output, drawing lines and shapes, and handling color.

4. **Lab 4**: Children Control Windows
   - Description: This lab dives into the concept of child windows in Windows applications. It demonstrates how to create and manage child windows within a parent window, enabling more complex user interfaces.

5. **Lab 5**: Multitasking and Multithreading
   - Description: This lab explores multitasking and multithreading concepts in Windows applications using WinAPI. It covers topics such as creating and managing multiple threads, thread synchronization, and communication between threads.

6. **Lab 6**: Working with Files
   - Description: This lab focuses on file operations in Windows applications using WinAPI. It covers topics such as file creation, reading, writing, and file navigation. It also demonstrates error handling techniques for file operations.

7. **Lab 7**: Development of Dynamic Libraries
   - Description: This lab delves into the development of dynamic libraries (DLLs) in C++ using WinAPI. It covers topics such as creating and using DLLs, exporting functions and data, and linking DLLs with applications.

8. **Lab 8**: Basics of Assembler Language
   - Description: This lab introduces the basics of assembly language programming in Windows applications. It covers topics such as registers, memory addressing modes, arithmetic and logical operations, and calling assembly functions from C++.

9. **Lab 9**: Use of Assembly Language
   - Description: In this lab, you will explore advanced uses of assembly language in Windows applications. It covers topics such as inline assembly, optimization techniques, and interfacing assembly code with C++.
